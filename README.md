# Rock Paper Scissors (Web Game)

A simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The game lets you play against the computer, keeps track of your score using `localStorage`, and displays results with emojis.

## How it works

- Click on **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
- The computer randomly chooses its move.
- The winner is decided by classic rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Paper beats Rock
  - Scissors beats Paper
- Your **wins**, **losses**, and **ties** are tracked and stored in your browserâ€™s `localStorage` (so they persist across reloads).
- You can reset the score with the **Reset Score** button.
